# Assembly Colorizer for Solid Edge

From a request made during Realize Live 2023 the idea to create this program.
The needings is a fast way to assign a random color to the occurrences of an assembly.
The tipicall scenario is to use it just after importing an exchange file when all the occurrence have the same gray color.

Still a work in progress

To be done: Make it faster, the idea is to open the file in background

Binary archive include for those who just want a pre-compiled file
